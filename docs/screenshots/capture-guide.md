## Setup Prerequisites

1. Have a running OpenCode Web server reachable from your device
2. Add at least 2 server profiles in the app (one default, one secondary)
3. Set the device to light mode for cleaner screenshots
4. Use iOS Simulator or Android Emulator for pixel-perfect captures
5. Set simulator/emulator to 100% scale (not Retina scaling)

## Capture Checklist

### Phone screenshots
- [ ] Landing (default server, ready state, green dot)
- [ ] Server list (2+ profiles, mixed statuses)
- [ ] Add server form (URL filled, auth toggled on)
- [ ] WebView connected (OpenCode interface visible)
- [ ] TopPullMenu (during active connection — shows Options panel)
- [ ] Settings (timeout values visible)
- [ ] Help (troubleshooting sections)

### Tablet screenshots
- [ ] Landing in landscape
- [ ] Server list in landscape
- [ ] WebView connected in landscape
- [ ] Settings in landscape

## Env Setup for Realistic Content

Before capturing:
1. Connect to a real OpenCode server with some files/directories visible
2. Make sure the server has a non-empty workspace
3. Have at least one server profile that shows "Connected" status
4. Have one profile that shows "Offline" (to show status variety on Server List)

## Scripts

Two scripts automate the capture workflow — one per platform.

### Android

```
npm run screenshots:android:open        # Build + sync + launch on connected device/emulator
npm run screenshots:android:capture <name>   # Capture current screen to docs/screenshots/android/<name>.png
npm run screenshots:android:guided      # Build → launch → step through all 7 screens with prompts
```

### iOS (macOS only)

```
npm run screenshots:ios:open            # Build + sync + launch on booted simulator
npm run screenshots:ios:capture <name>       # Capture current screen to docs/screenshots/ios/<name>.png
npm run screenshots:ios:guided          # Build → launch → step through all 7 screens with prompts
```

### Typical workflow

1. Boot your device/emulator first (Android emulator or iOS Simulator)
2. `npm run screenshots:{platform}:open` — builds, syncs, and launches the app
3. Navigate to the desired screen in the app manually
4. `npm run screenshots:{platform}:capture <name>` — captures whatever is on screen

Or use guided mode to step through all 7 screens sequentially:

```
npm run screenshots:android:guided      # Prompts before each capture
```

## After Captures

1. Files are already named per the convention above and saved to `docs/screenshots/{platform}/`
2. Upload to App Store Connect / Google Play Console
3. Reference these files in `store/app-store.md` and `store/play-store.md`
